        <li>½ small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 garlic finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Meatballs</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick vegetable oil spray</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten to blend</li>
        <li>¼ small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic finely chopped</li>
        <li>1½ pound ground turkey, preferably 93% lean or less</li>
        <li>1 10-oz. package frozen chopped spinach, thawed, squeezed in paper towels to remove excess moisture</li>
        <li>½ cup finely grated Parmesan or Pecorino</li>
        <li>½ cup plain dried breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Sauce</b>
    <p>Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook onion, stirring often, until soft but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes; season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomato paste and 1 Tbsp. water and cook, stirring, until tomato paste coats onion and begins to darken, about 3 minutes.</p>
    <p>Add tomatoes to saucepan, crushing with your hands as you add them. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and gently simmer until slightly thickened, 20–25 minutes; season with salt and pepper.</p>
    <b>Meatballs</b>
    <p>Preheat broiler. Cover a rimmed baking sheet with foil and coat with nonstick spray.</p>
    <p>Using your hands or a fork, gently mix egg, onion, garlic, turkey, spinach, Parmesan, breadcrumbs, parsley, fennel seeds, lemon zest, and salt in a large bowl just until combined. Scoop out turkey mixture by the ¼-cupful and form into balls (you should have about 20). Place on prepared baking sheet, spacing 2” apart; brush with oil.</p>
    <p>Broil meatballs, turning often, until browned all over and cooked through, 15–18 minutes. Add to marinara sauce.</p>
