    <h1>Coconut Rice</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>1½ cups jasmine rice (rinsed and drained)</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk (full-fat, not light)</li>
        <li>1¾ cups water</li>
        <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In a dry pan, toast coconut over medium-low heat, stirring until lightly browned and fragrant. About 4-5 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a medium saucepan, combine all other ingredients including rice, coconut milk, water, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a barely bubbling simmer, cover, and simmer until rice is fully cooked and liquid absorbed. About 20 minutes. There may be a bubbly top layer of coconut cream; poke with a fork to make sure rice is cooked. Remove from heat and fluff with a fork. Then, re-cover the saucepan and let stand for 5 minutes.

        Transfer to a serving bowl and top with toasted coconut.
