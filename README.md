# Host Your Personal Website With Firebase

Hosting a static website is easy with Firebase. The Firebase CLI let's you deploy changes almost instantly and roll-back mistakes just as quickly. When you connect your custom domain Firebase also manages your SSL certs.

I host my personal website [natashamitchko.com](https://www.natashamitchko.com) with firebase and the very simple code for that site is in this repo. 

Note to self:
firebase deploy --project natasha-mitchko
